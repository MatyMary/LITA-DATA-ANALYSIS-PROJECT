### SUMMARY ON SQL
SQL Overview
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It allows users to perform operations such as querying data, updating records, inserting new entries, and deleting data. SQL is essential for tasks like data retrieval and analysis in various applications, ranging from small projects to large enterprise systems.

Key Components
* SELECT: Retrieve data from one or more tables.
* INSERT: Add new records to a table.
* UPDATE: Modify existing data in a table.
* DELETE: Remove records from a table.
* JOIN: Combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns.
* WHERE: Filter results based on specific criteria.
* GROUP BY: Aggregate data for summarization.
